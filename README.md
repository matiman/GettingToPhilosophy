# GettingToPhilosophy

In order to see how this API works try to look at the following link http://www.xefer.com/wikipedia.
Type a title and it will show you a path to philosophy page.

On wikipedia page clicking every first link that is not italic, citation,external link, and a sound link, will finally lead to Philsophy.
For e.g if u go to en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness and click the first link that satisfies the above condition,it will lead you to 
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness repeating the same process will lead us finally to Philsophy page.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(philosophy)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy

Wikipedia has an api that exposes the "wiki text" (somehow formatted)of each page. All you have to do is add "?action=raw" at the end of each link
for e.g http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(philosophy)?action=raw will give us a text like the following

{{about|quality in the philosophical sense||quality (disambiguation)}}
In [[philosophy]], a '''quality''' (from [[Latin]] ''qualitas'')<ref>Morwood, J. (Ed.) (1995). ''The Pocket Oxford Latin Dictionary.'' Oxford</ref> is an attribute or a [[Property (philosophy)|property]].<ref name="Cargile, 1995">Cargile, J. (1995). qualities. in Honderich, T. (Ed.) (2005). ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (2nd ed.). Oxford</ref> In [[contemporary philosophy]] the [[idea]] of qualities, and especially how to distinguish certain kinds of qualities from one another, remains controversial.<ref name="Cargile, 1995"/>

==Background==
{{further|Property (philosophy)}}
[[Aristotle]] analyzed qualities in his [[logic]]al work, the ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]''. To him, qualities are [[hylomorphic]]ally–formal attributes, such as "white" or "grammatical". Categories of ''state'', such as "shod" and "armed" are also non–[[essential property|essential]] qualities ''([[sumbebekos|katà symbebekós]])''.<ref name="MIT_Cat_70">{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.1.1.html#70 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 70.</ref> Aristotle observed: "one and the selfsame substance, while retaining its identity, is yet capable of admitting contrary qualities. The same individual person is at one time white, at another black, at one time warm, at another cold, at one time good, at another bad. This capacity is found nowhere else... it is the peculiar mark of substance that it should be capable of admitting contrary qualities; for it is by itself changing that it does so".<ref name="MIT_Cat_254">{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.1.1.html#254 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 254.</ref> Aristotle described four types of qualitative opposites: ''correlatives,'' ''contraries,'' ''privatives'' and ''positives.''<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.3.3.html#254 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 28.</ref>

I looked at more than 50 pages to look at their similarity and all of the have their first link appear in a dobule square bracket
like [[THIS]]. This text shouldn't be rapped inside any brackets. If that is the case you have to skip it.

In the above case our link is  [[philosophy]] . 

The API I wrote in Java fetches this data, parse it to find the first link store in a database (if the path title doesn't exist in the database)
If the path already exists in the database it will return that path instead of fetching the data from wiki api which
is a bit faster. 
The database schema I used is pretty simple( though I believe there is a bettwer which I will explain latter)
SCHEMA: Table name
